I am a first year Ph.D student in the Numerical Linear Algebra group at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester. My supervisor is Professor Nick Higham and my co-supervisor is Professor Fran\c{c}oise Tisseur. I completed my undergraduate degree in Theoretical Physics, where I focused primarily on computational and numerical methods. I am also very interested in Machine and Deep Learning and HPC.
