I am a first year Ph.D student in the Numerical Linear Algebra group at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester. My supervisor is Professor Nick Higham and my co-supervisor is Professor Fran\\coise Tisseur. I completed my undergraduate degree in Theoretical Physics, where I focused primarily on computational and numerical methods. I am also very interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and HPC.
