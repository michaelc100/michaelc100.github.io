I am a first year Ph.D student in the Numerical Linear Algebra group at the
School of Mathematics, University of Manchester. My supervisor is Professor Nick
Higham and my co-supervisor is Professor Francoise Tisseur. I completed my
undergraduate degree in Theoretical Physics, where I focused primarily on
computational and numerical methods.
