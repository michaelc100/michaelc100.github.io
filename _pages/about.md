I am a first year PhD student in the [Numerical Linear Algebra
group](https://nla-group.org/) at the School of Mathematics, University of
Manchester. My supervisor is [Professor Nick
Higham](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/). I completed my
undergraduate degree in Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin, where I
focused primarily on computational and numerical methods.
